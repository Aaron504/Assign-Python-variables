# Assign Python Variables


 ### 

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, I will open a notebook environment to practice assigning values to variables in Python. I'll be presented with a security scenario to explore throughout the lab. I'll create variables to keep track of information relevant to the login process for approved users to log in to a specific device.

What I'll do
I'll have multiple tasks in this lab:

Assign variables of various data types

Use the type() function to return a variable's data type
<br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Python</b> 
  

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Jupyter</b> 

<h2>Lab Walkthrough:</h2>

In your work as an analyst, imagine there is a device only users specified on an allow list can access, and its device ID is "72e08x0". In the following code cell, assign this value to a variable named device_id. Then, display the contents of the variable and observe the output .: <br/>

<br />
<br />
Now that the variable device_id is defined, you can return its data type.

In this task, use a Python function to find the data type of the variable device_id. Store the data type in another variable called device_id_type. Then, display device_id_type to examine the output.  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Now, imagine that you've been informed that the previous list is not up-to-date and that there is another employee that now has access to the device. You're given the updated list of usernames with access, including the new employee, as follows: "madebowa", "jnguyen", "tbecker", "nhersh", "redwards", and "lpope".

In this task, reassign the variable username_list to the new list. Run the code to display the list before and after it's been updated to observe the difference. <br/>

<br />
<br />
In this task, define a variable called max_logins that represents the maximum number of login attempts allowed per user. Store the value 3 in this variable. Then, store its data type in another variable called max_logins_type. Display max_logins_type to examine the output. <br/>
